It’s in the laboratory, where the vaccines and medicines critical to creating a healthier world are being developed. [24] http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/health/healthcare-innovation/ It’s in the company’s collaborative working relationships with governments, schools, scientific institutions and partners such as the McLaren Technology Group. In fact, it underpins the organisation’s entire business model – and it always has done. [pullquoteMask_3337238a.png] GSK has always recognised the challenges it faces and taken steps to tackle them head-on in innovative ways GSK is made up of some 100,000 employees who spend every day thinking hard about how they can deliver a better outcome for the patients and consumers who depend on the company’s products. Their mission is to help people all over the world do more, feel better, live longer. In order to achieve this, GSK has never shied away from doing things differently throughout its 300-year history. It pioneered the development of antibiotics, spearheaded the fight against measles, rubella and polio, and helped to turn HIV/AIDs (once a death sentence) into a manageable chronic condition.

GSK’s continued success comes down to the fact that as a company, it has always recognised the challenges it faces and taken steps to tackle them head-on in innovative ways. Its research scientists, for instance, now work in small, tightly focused units – a much more effective way of creating new medicines and vaccines than the old, hierarchical R&D model. This has encouraged the teams to be more entrepreneurial, and made them more accountable. GSK also knows that the answers don’t always lie inside its laboratories. This is especially true where the work concerns illnesses that are hard to treat, such as Alzheimer’s disease.

For example, as part of its commitment to tackling 10 neglected tropical diseases by 2020, it has opened the doors of its Tres Cantos laboratory in Spain to scientists from outside GSK, who are free to pursue their own projects as part of an integrated team. This “open lab” programme is designed to increase the number of researchers working on diseases of the developing world on a genuinely no-strings-attached basis.

The aim is to shake things up and approach issues from a different perspective. Anything could happen – and that’s the beauty of it. These conversations, and the GSK projects they relate to, aren’t the end of the story – they’re a snapshot of a dynamic work in progress. There are still thousands of diseases without adequate treatments, millions of people who suffer from everyday ailments and millions without access to basic healthcare. These are the challenges facing us right now, in 2016 – and GSK is rising to them."
